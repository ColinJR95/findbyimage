[Open Sound Control (OSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)

OSC is kind of like MIDI in that it sends control data, but able to do a lot more, faster, and with finer grain.

UDP protocal - sent over a TCP/IP port that you choose. Each application can only listen to one port at a time, but as many symbolic “addresses” as you care to set up.

can be between programs, or between machines over a network.

wekinator was created by rebecca fiebrink -  training data is a user interface, can be used to design new types of interaction

wekinator is “supervised learning” - you train it by saying “if this, then that”

see [this list of examples](http://www.wekinator.org/examples/) for suggestions of inputs and outputs to couple with wekinator.

wekinator works in one of three modes (or a combination of the three):
- classification
- regression (continuous)
- dynamic time warping (gesture)
