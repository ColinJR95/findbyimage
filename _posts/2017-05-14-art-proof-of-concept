# **Core Question/Objective**

What does narrative mean?

*(almost anything can be called narrative, but what are the parameters? Character-driven narrative with a plot or?) What is the role of generative narrative? 

What does it look like? Why is it significant?

# **Roles and Workflow**

Mini-experiments with generative narrative
3 different approaches, and we focus in on the one with most potential

# **Questions for You**

What interests you the most out of this body of work?
How do you describe nontraditional narrative?
What is your preferred mode of narrative?

# **Final Form**

Creates itself in the moment but

*Preferred to not be interpreting narrative, solely generating

*It's not personally or emotionally driven at the moment, it's not authentically authored so we would like for the project to be viewed solely for its success in generation

*How far can we take narrative away from the human hand? (Temperature question, original and hard to understand or understandable but familiar)
