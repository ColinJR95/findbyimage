# Reactionary: Machine-performed Video Reactions

## Overall Concept
Creating a model that generates video of a distilled 'human reaction' in order to create absurd relationships between A&B sets of video.

## Data
* Youtube Reaction Videos
* Videos that I later make

## Questions and Considerations 
* What is performed reaction?
* How does the performed reaction relate to the expression of morality.
* How to build a generative adversarial network that accepts two datasets with the understanding that video A results in video B?
* How does machine learning of a tool suggest objectivity? 
* How can that suggestion be leveraged in service of the absurd?

## Outcomes
### Success
* A swirling mesh of human features in an oversaturated day-glo porno-lit youtube-vlogging color palette responding to videos of me handling objects in an untowards fashion.

### Failure 
* Mainly just technical failure, as in it doesn't work at all. I am kind of investedness in the 'incorrectness' of this gesture so as long as there is some unpredictable relationship between video A and video B with video B hinting at human facial expressions I'll be happy with it.
