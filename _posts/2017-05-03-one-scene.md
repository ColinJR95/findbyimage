# One Scene
Sarah B, Alice C, and Eric F


## Concept:
1. To create a non-human subjectivity through the assemblage of semantics [human] and syntactic [machine] components. 
2. The human curates material and interprets meaning. 
3. Machine generates and learns to manipulate human.


Neural network system as a submissive-responsive controller of the virtual space
* A default scene -> transition to different states
* “Branching” of the state based on user gaze, head movement
* Similar to recommendation system

State-machine -> generative audio-visuals
* User-feedback data -> generative 3D visuals and sounds
* Real/virtual environment + objects

## Implementation
#### Platform
Unity + C#?
#### Modules
###### Generative module
* Visual synthesis
* Sound synthesis
Either using ML technique (similar to wekinator) or rule-based (procedural)
###### Training module: clustering
* Input: Viewer’s action/behavior
* Output: New state
#### Library + Model
Deep Q Learning / reinforced learning?
#### Input
* Form: head direction (coordinate in 3d-space), head movement (acceleration data), verbal cues, questionnaire
* Dataset: have to run experiments, create one
#### Output
New state:
* Generate/eliminate object
* Change density/mood of sound
* Change timing/pace of transition
* Change mood of the background
* Change time-space orientation

## End Goal:
Affect: complete self-alienation

## Evaluation strategy
User comments! + Crit.
