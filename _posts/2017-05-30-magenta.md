create new instance using ubuntu trusty (14.04)

make sure to give it lots of memory (try 8 vCPU's and 52 gigabytes memory)

once the instane is created and running, launch an ssh terminal 

install a compiler:

`sudo apt-get install gcc`

install git:

`sudo apt-get install git`

you can now clone in the magenta repository at any time using:

`git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta.git`

now run the installer for the magenta environment (if this doesn't work, try the manual instructions [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta#installation)):

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/magenta/master/magenta/tools/magenta-install.sh > magenta-install.sh`

`bash magenta-install.sh`

`source ~/.bashrc`

this creates a virtual environment for magenta that you can now launch by typing

`source activate magenta`

you should see `(magenta)` in front of the terminal prompt now.

you can type `conda list` to see a list of installed packages.

for any dependencies required by magenta, make sure to activate the magenta environment before installing. for sketch_rnn, you need to install a specific version of svgwrite:

`conda install -c omnia svgwrite=1.1.6`

now, if you want to open a jupyter notebook, activate the magenta environment and then type:

`jupyter notebook --no-browser --allow-root`

which will give you a url with a token that you can paste in a browser...

...but first you need to open an ssh tunnel from your local terminal by typing:

`ssh -i .ssh/google_compute_engine -L 8888:localhost:8888 yourusername@your-instance-external-ip`

(you'll need to have set up ssh keys for this to work properly - see [how to create a cloud compute instance](https://publicityreform.github.io/findbyimage/create-compute-instance.html) for more info)
