# non-verbal communication ai : body language

## points of interest
* Either a translation of human body language or a technology / bot that would communicate back to you as well
* Non-verbal communication; a universal entity
*Reflecting on a modern age of communication of emotions and body notation (text, emojis, etc.) 

## considering
* What is the machine version of “sighing”? 
* All methods of expression we have is a result of our bodies. But the communication between software does not require to feel anything.
* Technology has sensory for humans; not for ‘themselves’
