# Interpreting Clouds: Final Ideation
##### Rosalind, Sophia and Zoe

![alt text](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/zoeingramsite/c_9.jpg)

This series explores the relationship between human psychology and digital machines. Rooted in the concept of Pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon triggered by the temporal lobe of the brain, where neurons are responsible for face and object recognition. This biological ability is vital in identifying predators, as well as parents for sustenance during infant development.

Using the intuitive pattern recognition skills that have developed and evolved over thousands of years of human history, paired with ideas that have only become possible with the invention of computers in the past 70 years, we can explore the way machine learning tools make use of Pareidolia.

Feeding refined and intentional image data through many layers of a Convolutional Neural Network, via TensorFlow, we have created a series of images and titles, given by our machine, in attempt to invoke human psychological phenomena through code.
