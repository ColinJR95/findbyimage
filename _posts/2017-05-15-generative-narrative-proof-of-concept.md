# Prime Directive
  - To ponder, question, and challenge what narrative means in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - To propose and explore a human-machine spectrum for contemporary narrative: human-told, human-interpreted; human-told, machine-interpreted; machine-told, human-interpreted; machine-told, machine-interpreted...
  
### Core Objective
  - Generate examples and projects that fit towards the right of the spectrum, as hybrids or as "purely" machine-operated.
  - Attempt to answer: What is the value of generative narrative? Why is it significant? Does it have to be?

### Roles and Workflow

Focusing on character-driven (first-person) narrative, we will begin with smaller-sized experiments as proposed:
  - Annie: video-GAN, neural-storyteller
  - Reginald: char-RNN, torch-RNN 
  - Tyler: char-RNN, neural-storyteller
Presently, we have approached char-RNN and torch-RNN with training data from Albert Camus, Joseph Conrad, Daniel Keyes, Haruki Murakami. After our individual attempts, we will merge our efforts towards the method with the most potential to generate a larger, more cohesive and fully-realized work.

### Questions
  - Narrative can be very loosely defined, but how do you define the parameters of conventional (or unconventional) stories?
  - What aspects of this project interests you the most?
  - What is your preferred mode of narrative?
  - Can generated narrative replace human stories? If not, what is the role or value of generative narrative?
  - Who is the author?
  - How does the absence(?) of human agency in the machine's writing "process" change the perceived meanings of the work? If the fact that the work was generated by a machine was obscured or hidden, would that elevate or alter perception of the narrative?
  - What is the ideal "temperature" for generated narrative? (Is it better to appear original with risk for heavy abstraction, or to be legible yet barely deviating from the original input?)

# Final Form
Our final project would ideally be generating stories in real-time, in response to a stimuli (for example: computer vision, object recognition, user-input, voice commands). In addition to human/environmental feedback, multiple machines may interact with each other in the act of storytelling.
