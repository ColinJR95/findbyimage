    <p>safe space / different kinds of knowldege tools
connecting the dots / wide view
maximum literacy and maximum access to resources - wayfinding</p>

<p>wont be teaching math or code or psychology or biology or philosophy
looking at high-level implementations of these approaches
	feel free to tinker!
	learn the basics enough to debug / combine / hack
as well as pre-built: wekinator, openframeworks</p>

<p>projects can take the form of critical writing, hacks, other dimensions</p>

<p>state of the field of AI: scattered, maybe will converge on one framework?
theory vs application. similar to early art interventions with other technologies (cv, video, internet</p>

<p>tradeoff: participating in open exchange of tools, knowledge and insight in a consolidated way (convergence), vs. preserving criticality, difference, diversity?</p>

<p>history:
lovelace
turing</p>

<p>rosenblatt - perceptron</p>

<p>image classification
limitations
cant do XOR</p>

<p>compare to logical gates?</p>

<p>minsky</p>

<p>other AI:
	Support Vector Machines
	decision forests
	boosting</p>

<p>early ML grew out of statistics / CV / DSP
	using expert knowledge to hand-craft feature engineering
	(classifiers / regressors)
	tools specific to domain (audio, image, text, etc)</p>

<p>problem of training, scaling</p>

<p>new ML derives from raw media (pixels / characters / words / samples)</p>

<p>timeline:</p>

<p>1980’s : geoff hinton - backpropagation / multilayer NN’s - training problem
1998: Yann LeCun - LeNet + handwritten check recognition
2006: CIFAR + deep learning conspiracy
2009: Convolutional NN (convnet) gets SOTA for speech-to-text
2010: first ImageNet challenge (yearly) - started w/ classical CV techniques
2012: AlexNet gets SOTA for image classification
	image classification is the basis - segmentation, description, etc. build on this
2013: ZFNet + deep learning investment boom
2014: theano, torch, keras, and other libraries / packages emerge
2015: creative boom w/ deep dream, stylenet
2016: resnets (image classification), tensorflow, alphago, research explosion</p>

<p>zoom out - theory / critical issues / wider applications</p>

<p>atari training - just looks at pixels and score (reward). one algorithm for various tasks
“transfer learning”</p>

<p>hive-mind clustering - tagging, annotating, added-data enriches objects</p>

<p>what is a feature?
characterization - treating “anything” as numerical data / parameterizable</p>

<p>anxiety over superintelligence?
artificial general intelligence
specific intelligence</p>

<p>importance of preserving different ways of knowing / different knowledge systems
problems of implicit bias and discrimination</p>

<p>algorithms that shape news and flow of information, human understanding of reality
rate of recidivism (propublica study)
financial systems
extra-judicial persecution
pressing concerns - climate change, inequality, problems of access etc
what does “open” really mean (in terms of tools, who’s providing them, datasets, etc)?</p>

<p>clear consideration of intentions + objectives
failure
ways of being “wrong”</p>

<p>what are poetics?</p>
