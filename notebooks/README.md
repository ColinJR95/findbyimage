to run these notebooks, you'll need to have [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) set up. 

most of the [deep learning docker containers](https://publicityreform.github.io/findbyimage/DL-Docker.html) include jupyter - run the container of your choice and type `jupyter notebook` to launch. depending on which port you've set for the notebook, you should be able to access it in a browser somewhere like `http://localhost:8888/`
