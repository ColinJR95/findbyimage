to be run from inside the [sketch-rnn github repo](https://github.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn)

click on the zip file and direct download using github's ui!

the "sketch_rnn-updated" and "sketch_rnn_train" notebooks are for use within the [magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn) environment... you'll need to set that up first by following the directions on their github, and then upload the "updated" notebook into the sketch_rnn directory to run it. it's very similar to the notebook they provide, with a few modifications to make it easier to save drawings and understand what's happening at each step.
