# Overview:

This studio-based course aims to introduce machine learning—a complex and quickly evolving field—to artists, designers and performers.The goal of this course will be to unpack and familiarize ourselves with available machine learning tools, which we will use to plan and produce works of art. In-class labs will open a preliminary investigation into the conceptual and technical underpinnings of key machine learning methods, exploring their application through hands-on demonstrations. Readings and discussions will attempt to connect the theory, practice, and poetics of machine learning, and to place our efforts into wider ethical, social, and art-historical contexts. In the process, we will expand on the general phenomena of learning, experience, and creativity as subject matters in themselves.
Students are encouraged to pursue a process that continues the development of their own specific artistic practice. However, this course places a strong emphasis on collaboration—because of the interdisciplinary focus of the course, and because realizing artistically viable projects with machine learning will require a bundle of specialized knowledges.Whatever our background, we are each in experimental territory!

# Course Goals:

As a group, we will be conducting original research with the aim of uncovering artistic and poetic possibilities in the practice of applied machine learning. Each student will learn the concepts behind common machine learning techniques, and apply these ideas to artistic projects of their own design.

# Expectations:

Students will be expected to collaborate - to share skills and resources; to document their work and make it available to a wider public; to properly credit and attribute components of collaborative work; to keep up with course readings, to come to class with questions prepared, and to take turns leading in-class analysis of the readings; to actively participate in group discussion and critique.The form and media of each studio project will be left open to each student - ideally we will explore a range of approaches.

# Assignments:

# Assignment 1: Art and Technology
- To be completed by each individual student and presented in a rapid “show and tell” style.
- Find an example (either contemporary, or from anytime in the last 50k years or so) of an artwork made concurrently with the emergence of a technology. identify the technology being used. “artwork”, “technology”, and “use” are all terms we can think about expansively. examples of artworks that use machine learning are of course welcome, but not expected. the aim is come up with a common critical and aesthetic framework for talking about art and technology. 

# Assignment 2: Everyday AI
- To be completed by each individual student and presented in a mode of the student’s choosing for in-class critique (video / photo / text documentation, graphic representation, interactive demo, online, etc)
- Identify a way that you are already engaging with AI in everyday life. Develop and document a process of exposing (breaking? interrupting? re-directing?) the limits of this AI.
- In this process, consider the following questions:
  - Who made this? (a company, or a government, individuals, or many people, what gender, age, class, location, etc)?
  - What do you imagine the motivation for making this was? What outcome was expected?
  - What artifacts (intentional or otherwise) does it produce (visual, textual, sonic, affective, etc)?
  - Can you point to moments when the technology performs in unexpected ways? 
  - Can you point to moments when the technology feels human? when it feels inhuman?
  - What have you given to this technology (data, time, attention, money, etc)?
  - What new questions does your interaction with this technology elicit?


# Assignment 3: White paper presentations
- In-class discussions led by groups of three.

White papers (or, variously, “whitepapers”) occupy an interesting literary territory between scientific publication and marketing tool. They serve to explain a specialized topic to a more general audience. A technique or concept may be explained, a problem identified, or a solution proposed. White papers may present experimental evidence that is designed to be independently repeated by readers, or it may only hint at or speculate on possibilities. 

For this assignment, each group of three will choose one paper to present collaboratively in class. The goal of your presentation should be to attempt a deeper understanding of new and interesting projects in the field of AI in general, and machine learning in specific. Your choice of paper should be based on your own curiosities, rather than any prior understanding or specialized knowledge.  

some possible questions to address in your presentation:
- what is the “problem” being presented by the paper? this may be presented as an “opportunity” instead of a problem - read carefully :)
- what methods, materials, and concepts are involved in solving this problem, or pursuing this opportunity? how open is access to these materials and methods?
- assume the paper is a marketing tool - what is the product? 
- how does the paper place itself in context (what can you tell from its tone, references to prior work, footnotes, etc?)
- are there other keywords or tags that you would apply to this paper to help other audiences find it?

walk us through the paper in detail. bring in supplementary materials / images / references if it is helpful. this is an exercise in literacy-building from multiple angles.

as for where to find papers, i'd like to focus on AI/machine learning/deep learning, but this can encompass all aspects from math to social science to ethics to infrastructure to design... it's a broad field for sure. i've listed a few sources [here]({{site.baseurl}}/readings#technical-reading-whitepapers). also, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a terrific repository of scientific papers - try searching for terms that interest you. ideally, we'll start with newer work: if the paper is older than 6 months or so, try to determine if newer work has been published that updates or revises the original publication.

# Assignment 4: Studio Project - to be completed by groups of three.

This is the primary project that each student will complete over the course of the class. Each project should start with an essential question related the poetics of machine learning, and progress towards becoming an artwork that makes use of machine learning techniques.

This project will be presented three times,  first as a **proposal**, second as a **proof of concept**, and third as a **finished artwork**. The design and final form of this project is completely up to the collaborative group, but should be a consideration from the proposal stage on. In-class critiques at each stage will help guide the group to refine their initial proposal and working process, and to make full use of available resources.

# Additional Course Materials and Readings
Throughout the course we will be reading and discussing critical texts, poetry, and speculative fiction, as well as looking at artwork for contextual and comparative examples. Students will be expected to apply an understanding of these materials in project critiques.
A range of additional resources for learning more about machine learning - textbooks, online courses, tutorials etc. are available [here](/resources.md), and we may make reference to them occasionally as needed.

# Grading:
Grading will be determined as follows:

Assignment 2: Everyday AI - (20%)

Assignment 3: White paper presentations - (10%)

Assignment 4: Studio Project (proposal) - (15%)

Assignment 4: Studio Project (proof of concept) - (15%) 

Assignment 4: Studio Project (final presentation) - (20%) 

Participation - (20%)

Participation can be summarized as “contributions to discussions and critique, sharing skills and resources, evident role within collaborative efforts.”

Studio projects will be evaluated through in-class critique, based on their artistic value, which we will describe as

1. The extent to which the artwork addresses its presentation within the context of fine art: its relation to historical antecedents and future possibilities, its critical function, its virtue as an object. 
2. Legibility: how meaning is articulated, both in terms of how you as an artist speak about the work, and in terms of how the work itself speaks.This doesn’t always have to be literal - Open-ended-ness, obscurity and ambiguity are qualities that can be legibly contained in an artwork.
3. Commitment to work: as demonstrated by the amount of time and care put into making the work (speci cally) and developing an individual artistic voice through practice (generally).
4. Economy of means: how well does the work make use of its available resources (material, skill, time, attention, and so on). 
5. The experiment, the risk: what new possibilities have been opened? what is at stake?

# Attendance:
If you are going to be late or miss a class, please email before the start of class. Each absence or lateness (more than 15 minutes) without prior notice will drop your grade by a half-step (A to A-, for example).
